          I am currently developing a tactical assistant application for
          "Teamfight Tactics" (TFT) players, designed to deliver real-time
          strategic guidance throughout their games. The application is being
          built to validate player IDs, fetch match histories via the Riot Games
          API, and offer tailored champion and item recommendations. As the
          match unfolds, my application will dynamically update its suggestions
          to help players refine their team compositions and strategic
          approaches. My goal is to craft a vital resource for TFT enthusiasts
          aiming to elevate their gameplay experience.
